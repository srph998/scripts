# scripts
Some scripts I'm archiving for later use.

I don't claim to own any of these, but these are scripts I have used and modified for various purposes. Chances are if you're here you know what they do.

* DD1_TowerStacking_Script_Modified.ahk
    Towerstacking script for DD1 using the legacy version of autohotkey
* capstoctrl.reg
    Quick windows 10 registry hack to swap the ctrl key to caps lock
* datetime.lua
    Simple lua script for displaying current date/time in OBS studio
* start_jack.sh
    Script for starting a jack audio server, kind of janky
* steam tricks.txt
    Some weird things that can be done with a Steam profile
